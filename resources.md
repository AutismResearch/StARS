Sharing knowledge is important to us, so we've linked some resources to help you learn how we do things in our lab. Feel free to borrow or adapt anything you like. 

### Websites and Wikis

Our website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [constrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme (both free).  We write down how we do things in our [Lab Wiki](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/) to share weâ€™ve learned with others. Inside you'll find our [Lab Handbook](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/resources/lab-handbook). Feel free to use either as a jumping off point to create your own -- we made them with [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/).


### Data Analysis

We like to analyze data in Jupyter notebooks via [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is kind of like RStudio. Here is a [JupyterLab demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo) and below is some more information about our lab's workflow in case you'd like to borrow it: 

- [How to analyze data with the jupyter/datascience-notebook](2021-01-09-datascience-container)
- [How to deploy a JupyterHub in the cloud for your department or lab](tljh-digital-ocean)
- [Working on shared code with Jupyterlab and git]()
- [Sharing your Jupyter notebooks with the scientific community]()
