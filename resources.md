Sharing knowledge is important to us, so we've linked some resources to help you learn how we do things in our lab. Feel free to borrow or adapt anything you like. 


- [Lab website](): Our website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [constrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme for jekyll. Hosting with Github Pages is free for everyone and setting up a website is straightforward.
- [Lab wiki](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/): We write down how we do things in our wiki to benefit our lab members and we keep it open to anyone to share weâ€™ve learned with others. We used [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to create it -- it's easy to use and free for eduction.
- [Lab handbook](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/resources/lab-handbook): Inside the lab's wiki, you'll find our lab's handbook. We like having a handbook and we think you would, too. Feel free to use ours as jumping off point to create your own.

### Data Analysis

We like to analyze data in Jupyter notebooks via Jupyterlab, which is kind of like RStudio. Here is some more information about our lab's workflow in case you'd like to borrow it:

- [Working on shared code with Jupyterlab and git]()
- [Sharing your work with the scientific community]()
