Sharing knowledge is important to us. Over the years, we've been helped a lot by friends and mentors who have taken the time to share what they've learned and show us how to do things. We want to pay it forward, so here are some resources to help you learn how we do things in our lab. Feel free to borrow or adapt anything you like. 


### Lab Website

Our website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the constrast theme. Hosting with Github Pages is free for everyone. 


### Lab Wiki

We write down how we do things in our [lab wiki](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/) to benefit our lab members. We keep the wiki open to the public so we can share what weâ€™ve learned with others. We used [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to create it -- it's easy to use and free for eduction.

### Lab Handbook

Inside the lab's wiki, you'll find our [Lab Handbook](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/resources/lab-handbook). We like having a handbook and we think you would, too. Feel free to use ours as jumping off point to create your own.
