Sharing knowledge is important to us. We've been helped by many generous friends and mentors who have taken the time to share what they know and show us how to do things. We want to pay it forward, so we've linked some resources to help you learn how we do things in our lab. Feel free to borrow or adapt anything you like. 


### Lab Website

Our website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the constrast theme. Hosting with Github Pages is free for everyone. 


### Lab Wiki

We write down how we do things in our [lab wiki](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/) to benefit our lab members. We keep the wiki open to anyone so we can share what weâ€™ve learned with others. We used [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to create it -- it's easy to use and free for eduction.

### Lab Handbook

Inside the lab's wiki, you'll find our [Lab Handbook](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/resources/lab-handbook). We like having a handbook and we think you would, too. Feel free to use ours as jumping off point to create your own.

### Web Experiments



### Data Analysis

We mostly analyze data in Jupyter notebooks via Jupterlab, but some lab members prefer RStudio. We have a JupyterHub running on a server so we can access our work from any browser. Here is some more information about our lab's workflow:

- [How to install The Littlest JupyterHub on a Digital Ocean server for your lab](tljh-digital-ocean)
- [Our Jupyter Workflow part I: working on shared lab code with the jupyterlab-git extension]()
- [Our Jupyter Workflow part II: sharing executable notebooks with others via binder]()
