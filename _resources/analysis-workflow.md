Repository setup
We have two repos: 
1. publications-sandbox  (private)
2. publications (public)

We work on our analysis in the private analysis sandbox; this is where we develop our analyses and stuff. We've made the public repo a remote for the private one; so we git push publish.

But that won't work because anyone working on the master's code will get published. 


create a branch for each person....
